# customer-churn-prediction

Overview

    This project focuses on predicting customer churn, a crucial concern for businesses. Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers stop doing business with a       company. Predicting churn can help businesses identify at-risk customers and take proactive measures to retain them. In this project, we utilize machine learning             techniques to predict customer churn based on various features provided in the "customers.csv" dataset.
